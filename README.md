# Dondi Lib React Native App
Code for the React Native App used in this design.

## Getting started

This app was primarily designed for iOS. Android is untested. 

This app does require node.js so make sure you have it installed along with `npm` and `yarn`

1. Install Xcode
1. Run `yarn install` in your directory. 
1. Open the project file in the `ios` folder with Xcode 
1. Build and run as needed. 

If you do not need to build the app but simply run the javascript bundler you can also use `npm start` to do so. Xcode is not needed here.

## Modifying

All the logic is in the `Home.js` file. I hacked it so the screens are just pop-overs instead of developing a more complex app structure.
